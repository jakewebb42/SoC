The goal of this project is to demonstrate the PWM system of a model car. This consists of using the Nexys4 DDR board to interface with 5 servo motors, 4 of those being continuous servo motors. In general, the car should be able to drive, meaning that the continuous servo motors should be able to controlled in both speed and direction (essentially, it should be able to drive forward, in reverse, or stay still). The car should also be able to steer, meaning that the normal servo motor should be able to be controlled in its orientation (essentially, it should be able to point to the left, to the center, and to the right). This project simply aims to show the motor system, not the physical build.
